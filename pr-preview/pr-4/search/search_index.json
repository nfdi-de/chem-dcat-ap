URI: https://stroemphi.github.io/dcat-4C-ap/dcat-4C-ap Name: dcat-4C-ap Classes Class Description Activity See DCAT-AP specs:Activity ActivityOfInterest An activity or process that is being evaluated in a ResearchActivity. ChemicalReaction An experimental procedure with the aim of producing a portion of a given compound or mixture. ResearchActivity An activity (process) that has the objective to produce information about an entity by evaluating it. NMRSpectroscopy Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them. Catalogue See DCAT-AP specs:Catalogue NFDICatalog A curated collection of metadata about data resources. CataloguedResource See DCAT-AP specs:CataloguedResource CatalogueRecord See DCAT-AP specs:CatalogueRecord ChemicalEntity Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity. ClassifierMixin A mixin with which an entity of this schema can be classified via an additional rdf:type assertion. DataService See DCAT-AP specs:DataService Dataset See DCAT-AP specs:Dataset NFDIDataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations.

Distribution See DCAT-AP specs:Distribution EntityOfInterest Something (not an activity or process) that is being evaluated in a ResearchActivity. ChemicalSubstance A portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular entities of the same type or of different types that is being evaluated in a scientific process. ChemicalSample None Environment The environment in which the dataset creating Observation took place (e.g. a lab). Laboratory A facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. Plan A piece of information that specifies: a) how an activity has to be carried out by its agents and b) the attributes of the passive activity participants that are used by the agents in terms of their presence and magnitude. QualitativeAttribute A piece of information that is attributed to an entity of interest, tool or environment. InChi A structure descriptor which conforms to the InChI format specification. InChIKey None IUPACChemicalFormula A systematic name which is formulated according to the rules and recommendations for chemical nomenclature set out by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). SMILES A structure descriptor that denotes a molecular structure as a graph and conforms to the SMILES format specification. QuantitativeAttribute A quantifiable piece of information that is attributed to an entity of interest, tool or environment.
