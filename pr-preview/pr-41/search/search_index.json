URI: https://stroemphi.github.io/dcat-4C-ap/dcat_4c_ap Name: dcat-4C-ap Classes Class Description Activity An activity (process) that has the objective to produce information about an entity or activity. DataAnalysis An Activity that evaluates the data produced by another Activity. NMRSpectralAnalysis A DataAnalysis which assigns a chemical structure to the peaks of a NMRSpectrum generated by a NMRSpectroscopy NMRSpectroscopy Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them. Agent See DCAT-AP specs:Agent Any This abstract class is needed to create the union of Dataset, DatasetSeries, Catalogue and DataService for the range of the slot primary_topic . Catalogue See DCAT-AP specs:Catalogue CatalogueRecord See DCAT-AP specs:CatalogueRecord Checksum See DCAT-AP specs:Checksum ChemicalEntity Any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity. ClassifierMixin A mixin with which an entity of this schema can be classified via an additional rdf:type or dcterms:type assertion. DataService See DCAT-AP specs:DataService Dataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations. AnalysisDataset A Dataset that was generated by an analysis of some previously generated data. For example, a dataset that contains the data of an assignment of a chemical structure to a sample based on the spectral data obtained from the sample is an AnalyticalDataset. NMRAnalysisDataset A dataset that is the result of a NMRSpectralAnalysis of a ChemicalSample. DatasetSeries See DCAT-AP specs:DatasetSeries DefinedTerm A word, name, acronym or phrase that is defined in a controlled vocabulary (CV) and that is used to provide an additional rdf:type or dcterms:type of a class within this schema. Distribution See DCAT-AP specs:Distribution EvaluatedActivity An activity or proces that is being evaluated in a Activity. ChemicalReaction An experimental procedure with the aim of producing a portion of a given compound or mixture. EvaluatedEntity A physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects that is not an activity or process and that is being evaluated in a Activity. AnalysisSourceData Information that was evaluated within a DataAnalysis. NMRSpectrum A set of chemical shifts obtained via NMR spectroscopy. ChemicalSubstance A portion of matter of constant composition, composed of molecular entities of the same type or of different types that is being evaluated in a scientific process. ChemicalSample None Instrument An entity that is actively used within an Activity as a means to achieve the planned objectives of said Activity because of its function. Device A material instrument that is designed to perform a function primarily by means of its mechanical or electrical nature. Software An instrument composed of a series of instructions that can be interpreted by or directly executed by a computer. Kind See DCAT-AP specs:Kind Location See DCAT-AP specs:Location Plan A piece of information that specifies how an activity has to be carried out by its agents including what kind of steps have to be taken and what kind of parameters have to be met/set. QualitativeAttribute A piece of information that is attributed to an EvaluatedEntity, Instrument or Surrounding. InChi A structure descriptor which conforms to the InChI format specification. InChIKey None IUPACChemicalFormula A systematic name which is formulated according to the rules and recommendations for chemical nomenclature set out by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). SMILES A structure descriptor that denotes a molecular structure as a graph and conforms to the SMILES format specification. QuantitativeAttribute A quantifiable piece of information that is attributed to an EvaluatedEntity, Instrument or Surrounding. Relationship See DCAT-AP specs:Relationship SupportiveEntity The supportive entities are supporting the main entities in the Application Profile.
