DataAnalysis An Activity that evaluates the data produced by another Activity. EvaluatedActivity An activity or process that is being evaluated in a DataGeneratingActivity. ChemicalReaction A process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another and that is the subject matter of a DataGeneratingActivity. Agent See DCAT-AP specs:Agent AgenticEntity An entity that is somehow responsible for an Activity to take place. Catalyst A ChemicalSubstance or MaterialEntity that initiates or accelerates a ChemicalReaction without itself being affected. Device A material instrument that is designed to perform a function primarily by means of its mechanical or electrical nature. Reactor A reactor is a container for controlling a biological or chemical reaction or process.

DataService See DCAT-AP specs:DataService Dataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations. AnalysisDataset A Dataset that was generated by an analysis of some previously generated data. For example, a dataset that contains the data of an assignment of a chemical structure to a sample based on the spectral data obtained from the sample is an AnalyticalDataset.

PHValue Pressure Temperature A physical quantity that quantitatively expresses the attribute of hotness or coldness. Volume A measure of regions in three-dimensional space. Yield A dimensionless physical quantity describing the fraction of a product B that is formed from a reactant A taking into account the stoichiometry. If A fully reacts to B without side-reactions, the yield of product B is 1 (or 100 %).

They are included in the Application Profile because they form the range of properties. no Any This abstract class is needed to create the union of Dataset, DatasetSeries, Catalogue and DataService for the range of the slot primary_topic. no DataService See DCAT-AP specs:DataService yes QuantitativeAttribute A quantifiable piece of information that is attributed to an Entity, Activity or AgenticEntity. no Resource See DCAT-AP specs:Resource no Standard See DCAT-AP specs:Standard no InChIKey no Concentration A QuantitativeAttribute of a ChemicalSubstance that represents the amount of a constituent divided by the volume of the mixture. no Reactor A reactor is a container for controlling a biological or chemical reaction or process. no SMILES A structure descriptor that denotes a molecular structure as a graph and conforms to the SMILES format specification. no QualitativeAttribute A piece of information that is attributed to an Entity, Activity or AgenticEntity. no RightsStatement See DCAT-AP specs:RightsStatement no TimeInstant See DCAT-AP specs:TimeInstant no Catalogue See DCAT-AP specs:Catalogue yes MolecularFormula A structure descriptor which identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates the number of atoms of each element found in each discrete molecule of that compound. no AnalysisDataset A Dataset that was generated by an analysis of some previously generated data. For example, a dataset that contains the data of an assignment of a chemical structure to a sample based on the spectral data obtained from the sample is an AnalyticalDataset. no Laboratory A facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. no Temperature A physical quantity that quantitatively expresses the attribute of hotness or coldness. no Yield A dimensionless physical quantity describing the fraction of a product B that is formed from a reactant A taking into account the stoichiometry. If A fully reacts to B without side-reactions, the yield of product B is 1 (or 100 %). no PercentageOfTotal A dimensionless ratio that quantifies the stoichiometric proportion of a chemical substance relative to a reference substance in a chemical reaction. no Role See DCAT-AP specs:Role no MolarMass A Mass (physical quality) that quantifies the mass of a homogeneous ChemicalSubstance containing 6.02 x 10^23 atoms or molecules. no DataGeneratingActivity An Activity (process) that has the objective to produce information (in form of a dataset) about another Activity or Entity. no"},{"location":"elements/slots/description/#properties","title":"Properties","text":"<ul> <li>Range: String</li> </ul>"},{"location":"elements/slots/description/#identifier-and-mapping-information","title":"Identifier and Mapping Information","text":""},{"location":"elements/slots/description/#schema-source","title":"Schema Source","text":"<ul> <li>from schema: https://w3id.org/nfdi-de/dcat-ap-plus/chemistry/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"elements/slots/description/#mappings","title":"Mappings","text":"Mapping Type Mapped Value self dcterms:description native chemdcatap:description"},{"location":"elements/slots/description/#linkml-source","title":"LinkML Source","text":"<pre><code>name: description\ndescription: This slot is described in more detail within the class in which it is\n  used.\nfrom_schema: https://w3id.org/nfdi-de/dcat-ap-plus/chemistry/\nrank: 1000\nslot_uri: dcterms:description\nalias: description\ndomain_of:\n- Activity\n- AgenticEntity\n- Any\n- Attribution\n- Catalogue\n- CatalogueRecord\n- ChecksumAlgorithm\n- Concept\n- ConceptScheme\n- DataService\n- Dataset\n- DatasetSeries\n- Distribution\n- Document\n- Entity\n- Frequency\n- Geometry\n- Identifier\n- LegalResource\n- LicenseDocument\n- LinguisticSystem\n- MediaType\n- MediaTypeOrExtent\n- PeriodOfTime\n- Plan\n- Policy\n- ProvenanceStatement\n- QualitativeAttribute\n- QuantitativeAttribute\n- Resource\n- RightsStatement\n- Role\n- Standard\n- SupportiveEntity\n- Surrounding\n- TimeInstant\nrange: string\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"elements/slots/documentation/","title":"Slot: documentation","text":"<p>This slot is described in more detail within the class in which it is used.</p> <p>URI: foaf:page Alias: documentation</p>"},{"location":"elements/slots/documentation/#applicable-classes","title":"Applicable Classes","text":"Name Description Modifies Slot DataService See DCAT-AP specs:DataService yes Distribution See DCAT-AP specs:Distribution yes Dataset A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations. yes AnalysisDataset A Dataset that was generated by an analysis of some previously generated data.
